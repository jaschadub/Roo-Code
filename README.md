  <h1>Rook Code</h1>
  <p><strong>Security conscious coding agents for VSCode. Zero Trust for AI.</strong></p>
</div>

**Rook Code** is a security-focused **autonomous coding agent** forked from Roo Code that lives in your editor. Built with a "Zero Trust for AI" philosophy, it provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining powerful AI capabilities. Rook Code can:

- Communicate in natural language with comprehensive input sanitization
- Read and write files with enhanced access controls and path validation
- Run terminal commands through secure sandboxing and isolation
- Automate browser actions with security monitoring
- Integrate with any OpenAI-compatible or custom API/model using secure protocols
- Adapt its "personality" and capabilities through **Custom Modes** with security boundaries

Whether you're seeking a flexible coding partner, a system architect, or specialized roles like a QA engineer or product manager, Rook Code helps you build software more efficiently while maintaining the highest security standards.

- **Violation Tracking** - Real-time monitoring of security violations
- **Access Control** - Time-limited permissions with automatic revocation
- **SchemaPin Integration** - TOFU (Trust-On-First-Use) key pinning for schema verification

### Security-Enhanced Customization

Make Rook Code work your way with security-conscious features:

- **Secure Custom Instructions** - Personalized behavior within security boundaries
- **Protected Custom Modes** - Specialized tasks with configurable security levels
- **Validated Local Models** - Offline use with security monitoring
- **Controlled Auto-Approval** - Faster workflows with security oversight

## üîí Security Framework Details

- **Security Level Configuration** - STRICT/MODERATE/PERMISSIVE security policies
- **Violation Tracking** - Real-time monitoring and logging of security violations

### Command Execution Security

- **Command Validation** - Secure parameter validation and sanitization
- **Sandbox Management** - Isolated execution environments with resource limits
- **Path Security** - Comprehensive path validation and traversal prevention
- **Execution Monitoring** - Real-time command execution tracking

### Access Control Enhancement

### Security Levels

#### STRICT

- Maximum security restrictions for untrusted servers
- Blocks file paths, URLs, and shell commands
- Minimal object depth and property limits
- Recommended for external or unknown MCP servers

#### MODERATE (Default)

- Balanced security and functionality
- Allows file paths and URLs but blocks shell commands
- Reasonable limits for most use cases
- Recommended for general-purpose usage

#### PERMISSIVE

- Higher limits for complex data processing
- Use only for fully trusted internal servers

## Resources

## Local Setup & Development

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaschadub/Roo-Code.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. **Run the extension**:

Press `F5` (or **Run** ‚Üí **Start Debugging**) in VSCode to open a new window with Rook Code running.

Changes to the webview will appear immediately. Changes to the core extension will require a restart of the extension host.

Alternatively you can build a .vsix and install it directly in VSCode:

```sh
pnpm vsix
```

A `.vsix` file will appear in the `bin/` directory which can be installed with:

```sh
code --install-extension bin/roo-cline-<version>.vsix
```

### Security Testing

Run comprehensive security tests:

```bash
# Run all security framework tests
npx vitest run src/utils/security/__tests__

# Run MCP security integration tests
npx vitest run src/core/tools/__tests__/useMcpToolTool.security.spec.ts
npx vitest run src/core/tools/__tests__/accessMcpResourceTool.security.spec.ts
```

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and publishing. Check our `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.

## Security Disclaimer

**Rook Code implements comprehensive security controls** including input sanitization, command execution sandboxing, access control, and network security enforcement. However, no security system is perfect. Users should:

- Regularly review security logs and violation reports
- Keep Rook Code updated to receive latest security patches
- Use appropriate security levels for different environments
- Monitor for unusual patterns or attempted attacks
- Report security issues through responsible disclosure

You assume **all risks** associated with the use of any AI coding tools. Rook Code is provided on an **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** basis with comprehensive security controls but no absolute guarantees.
