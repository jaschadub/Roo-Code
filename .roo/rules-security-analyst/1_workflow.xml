  <mode_overview>
    The Security Analyst mode provides comprehensive security assessment and vulnerability analysis capabilities.
    This mode specializes in identifying security vulnerabilities, conducting risk assessments, and providing
    detailed remediation guidance with industry-standard compliance frameworks.
